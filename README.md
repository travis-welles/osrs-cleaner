# OSRS Cleaner
OSRS Cleaner is a simple to use GUI based tool for both remapping
and deobfuscating the OSRS client from Jagex. The goal of this tool is 
to combine all the benefits of various outdated tools into one easy to 
maintain project.

## Notice
This project is currently early in development and has not officially released yet.
The README will be updated as the project progresses.

## Contributing
With this project being community driving WE NEED YOUR HELP. The best thing you can do
is assist with the initial remapping efforts.

Fork the repository https://github.com/travis-welles/osrs-client-mapped and start renaming classes, methods, and fields.
This is the project which I will be generating the first round of mappings from at release.
